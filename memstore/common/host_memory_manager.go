package common

// HostMemoryManager manages archive batch storage in host memory.
// Specifically, it keeps track of memory usage of archive batches and makes
// preloading and eviction decisions based on retention config.
//
// The space available to archive batches is defined as maxMem - unmanagedMem,
// where unmanagedMem accounts for C allocated buffers in live batches and
// primary keys, which changes over time.
// Eviction of archive batches is configured at column level using two configs:
// preloadingDays and priorities.
//
// Data eviction policy is defined as such:
// Always evict data not in preloading zone first; Preloading data wonâ€™t be
// evicted until all the non-preloading data are evicted and server is still
// in short of memory.
// For data within the same zone, eviction will happen based on column priority
// For data with same priority, eviction will happen based on data time,
// older data will be evicted first, for same old data, larger size columns
// will be evicted first;
//
// HostMemoryManger will also maintain two go routines. One for preloading data
// and another for eviction. Calling start to start those goroutines and call
// stop to stop them. Stop is a blocking call.
//
// Both TriggerPreload and TriggerEviction are asynchronous calls.
